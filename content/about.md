I'm Yu Chao. I got my BSc. Computer Science degree at the Chinese University of Hong Kong and I'm currently a software engineer located at Taipei.

<br />

This blog is a trash dump for my technical articles, but you might see some non-technical ones here occasionally.

<br />

This blog was named "Shine Right Studio" 5 years ago because "Shine" and "Right" are homophones of my name when directly translated into Mandarin. Now I think it is pretty dumb and cringy, but I am too lazy to change it.

# TL;DR
I am a good person.
