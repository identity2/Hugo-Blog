*THIS GAME IS A PROTOTYPE. IT WAS IMPLEMENTED ONLY TO TEST OUT AND DEMONSTRATE THE CORE IDEA, SO MOST OF THE GRAPHICS AND GAME ASSETS ARE PLACEHOLDERS.*

## Core Idea
Quantum Game (yeah I know, what a bad title) is an action game which the players should switch between being an electron or a proton to overcome obstacles in the level.

<br />

Electron and proton have difference sets of abilities, and are attracted/repelled by different objects.

<br />

The final bosses of the levels are all elements of the periodic table, they all have unique attacks patterns and appearances according to it's application in the real world. I implemented the first three periods in this prototype.
